OMMS8bit-MPS
============

OMMS8bit-MPS is my attempt at adding an 8-bit wrapper around Apple's Metal Performance Shaders (MPS) library. 

It is directly inspired by @TimDettmers' bitsandbytes 8-bit wrapper around CUDA functions for optimizers, matrix multipliers and quantization.

This is being done for fun and self-education. Not guaranteed at all to work, just exploring ideas right now.
